Google Hacking:

Google hacking, also known as Google dorking, is a technique that involves using advanced operators to perform targeted searches on Google. These operators can be used to search for specific types of information, such as sensitive data that may have been inadvertently exposed on the web. Here are some advanced operators that can be used for Google hacking:

site: This operator allows you to search for pages that are within a specific website or domain. For example, "site:example.com" would search for pages that are on the example.com domain.
Following searches for all the sites that is in the domain yahoo.com

filetype: This operator allows you to search for files of a specific type. For example, "filetype:pdf" would search for all PDF files.

intext: This operator allows you to search for pages that contain specific text within the body of the page. For example, "intext:password" would search for pages that contain the word "password" within the body of the page.

## dnsenum
Dnsenum is a multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks. The main purpose of Dnsenum is to gather as much information as possible about a domain. The program currently performs the following operations:

## smtp-user-enum
Username guessing tool primarily for use against the default Solaris SMTP service. Can use either EXPN, VRFY or RCPT TO.

In metasploit list all the usernames using head /etc/passwd or cat /etc/passwd:

select any username in the first column of the above file and check the same


#Telnet for smtp enumeration
Telnet allows to connect to remote host based on the port no. For smtp port no is 25
telnet <host address> 25 to connect
and issue appropriate commands
